	<h1>Carnivorous Plants</h1>
	<h2 class = history>History</h2>
	<p>Around 70 million years ago, back when dinosaurs still ruled the earth, a genetic mutation allowed for some plants to be able to consume meat, morphing their leaves and root structure. This actually allowed these plants to grow in soil with extremely low nutrient content, because they would be able to get all the nitrogen they needed from their prey. Funnily enough, carnivorous plants don't completely rely on the food they consume for all the nutrients they need, as they are still able to utilize the power of photosynthesis. All these years later, these plants have now spread to every continent in the world except for Antartica, and have developed many unique ways of capturing and consuming prey.</p>
	<h2>Plant Mechanisms</h2>
	<p>Over the years, these plants have evolved into their own species and have a multitude of options when it comes to caputring their prey. These include:
		<dl>
			<dt>Pitfall traps</dt>
			<dd>the prey fall into the stomach</dd>
  			<dt>Flypaper traps</dt>
  			<dd>prey get stuck to an adhesive</dd>
  			<dt>Snap traps</dt>
  			<dd>prey become entombed</dd>
  			<dt>Bladder traps</dt>
  			<dd>prey get sucked in</dd>
  			<dt>Lobster pot traps </dt>
  			<dd>force prey to move towards their digestive organ</dd>
  		</dl>
	</p>
	<p>
	These are the main 5 mechanisms that these plants use to consume their prey, and I will be going more in depth on the first three plants in this list. Also, here's a really interesting website containing more facts and details about these plants:
