	<h1>Pitcher Plant</h1>
	<p>The Pitcher Plant is a very interesting plant that lures in its prey and makes them slip into its cavernous stomach. It's shaped similar to a really long pear, with a mouth that produces sweet nectar near its edges so that it can lure in insects. Once the insects go to the mouth of the plant to eat the nectar, it slips into the plant's stomach because the edges of the mouth are ribbed, which is impossible to cling onto if you're an insect. Something that's also really cool is that spiders camp out in the plant's mouth to pounce on any insect that comes for the nectar, which I think is super intuitive and smart of the spider to do. This plant is native to Alabama and also loves growing in sandy or nutrient poor soil. It's diet includes:
		<ul>
  			<li>Ants</li>
  			<li>Beetles</li>
  			<li>Flying insects</li>
  			<li>Caterpillars</li>
		</ul>
