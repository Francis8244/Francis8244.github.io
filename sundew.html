	<h1>Sundews</h1>
	<p>The Sundews are a carnivorous plant that works like flypaper, where insects get caught in their sticky residue and are consumed. They make up on of the largest groups of carnivorous plants, and they have a long green stem with long red bristles sticking out from it. At the end of these bristles contain a fat droplet that looks like a dewdrop, but in reality, it's a super sticky substance that ensnares the insect. Once an insect gets stuck on the droplet, it makes a lot of movement that alerts the plant to curl in its stem on the insect, digesting it. Sundews are actually found in most of the USA besides the southwest, and they prefer bogs and poor soil. It's diet includes:
		<ul>
  			<li>Mosquitos</li>
  			<li>Other flying insects</li>
		</ul>
