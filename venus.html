	<h1>Venus Flytrap</h1>
	<p>The Venus Flytrap is most likely the first type of carnivorous plant that comes to your mind when you think of these plants. This plant works by having a sort of spring-locked jaw that activates when a bug touches the hairs on its mouth. You might be thinking that there might be some false alarms if something that's not a bug happens to touch the hairs, but the plant already accounts for this, making sure that hairs are brushed up against multiple times before it activates its trap. This plant is native to South and North Carolina, but it has found its way to Florida and New Jersey. It thrives best when it's placed in acidic, moist soil that contains little nutrients. These plants are perennial, and each trap on the plant has a max usage of a few times, which then withers off and grows a new one. It's diet includes:
